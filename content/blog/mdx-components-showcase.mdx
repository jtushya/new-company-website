# Component Showcase: Using MDX in Your Blog

This guide demonstrates all the custom components available for your blog posts using MDX.

## Basic Text Formatting

You can write normal paragraphs with **bold** and *italic* text. Links work too - visit [our homepage](/) or [external sites](https://github.com).

## Lists

Unordered lists:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with nested content
  - Sub-item 1
  - Sub-item 2

Ordered lists:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use it to highlight important information or quotes from other sources.
> 
> You can have multiple paragraphs in blockquotes.

## Alert Components

### Info/Tip Alert

<Tip>
  Here's a useful tip about using our components. Tips are great for providing additional context or helpful information.
</Tip>

### Warning Alert

<Warning>
  Be careful with this feature. Warnings help highlight potential issues or important considerations.
</Warning>

### Success Alert

<Success>
  Operation completed successfully! Use success alerts to confirm positive outcomes.
</Success>

### Error Alert

<Error>
  Something went wrong. Error alerts help communicate problems or critical warnings.
</Error>

## Code Blocks

Simple inline code: `const greeting = "Hello, world!";`

Code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// This is a JavaScript code block
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items
    .filter(item => item.inStock)
    .reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0);
}
```

## Custom Card Component

<Card title="Special Feature">
  This card component is perfect for highlighting special content or features.
  You can include any markdown content inside the card.

  - Lists work
  - **Bold** and *italic* too
  - Even code: `console.log('hello')`
</Card>

## Call to Action Component

<CallToAction href="/contact">
  Ready to start your digital transformation journey?
</CallToAction>

## Code Block with Title

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  content: string;
}

function formatDate(date: string): string {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString();
}
</CodeBlock>

## Best Practices

1. Use alerts sparingly to maintain their impact
2. Keep code blocks focused and well-commented
3. Break up long content with headings and cards
4. Use call-to-actions strategically

<Tip>
  Remember to preview your post before publishing to ensure all components render correctly.
</Tip>
